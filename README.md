### Insights

- The **PERT model** outperforms both BERT and GPT models in terms of accuracy and F1 score on the Quora Question Answer dataset. The significant improvement in the PERT model suggests that permutation language modeling (PerLM) is effective for the task of duplicate question detection.
- **Data Characteristics:** The dataset's imbalance affects model performance, making it more challenging to accurately predict the minority class (duplicates). Handling this imbalance is crucial for improving model accuracy.

### Recommendations

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Ensure thorough cleaning of the dataset to remove non-ASCII characters and handle empty strings using regular expressions and appropriate string handling methods.

2. **Model Improvement:**
   - Experiment with different model architectures and pre-training tasks to identify the most effective approach for the specific task. Explore other pre-training tasks like span prediction or next sentence prediction.
   - Fine-tune hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and the number of training epochs to optimize model performance using grid search or Bayesian optimization.

3. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - Incorporate additional evaluation metrics like BLEU and ROUGE alongside accuracy and F1 score to get a comprehensive understanding of model performance, especially for tasks involving text generation and translation.

4. **Visualization and Analysis:**
   - Create detailed visualizations to compare the performance of different models using confusion matrices, precision-recall curves, and ROC curves.
   - Visualize data distribution and feature importance to gain insights into which features contribute most to model predictions.

5. **Future Work:**
   - Investigate the impact of different pre-training datasets on model performance. Larger and more diverse datasets may help improve the model's ability to generalize.
   - Explore transfer learning by fine-tuning models pre-trained on other large-scale datasets (e.g., OpenAI's GPT-3) on the Quora dataset to leverage additional knowledge.
